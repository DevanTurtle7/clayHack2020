# Clay Hack 2020
## Purpose
Shopping at the corner store can be difficult; you have to keep track of your meal exchanges, find what you're looking for, and sometimes the prices aren't even listed! Corner Clerk conveniently lists every item at the corner store and keeps track of your money for you.

## How I built it
Devan and Jose built corner clerk using Flutter, a software development framework by Google. We chose flutter because it allowed us to easily and rapidly develop the app for both iOS and Android with a single code base. Additionally, the hot reload feature sped up development and allowed us to make fine tuned changes very quickly.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Jose was inexperienced with Flutter before today, but quickly picked it up over the course of the day. We were both a little overwhelmed at the beginning of the day with the task of creating an entire app in 8 hours, but we were able to pull it off.

## What's next for Corner Clerk
We'd like to expand the reach of Corner Clerk and provide more items, more accurate pricing, more stores, and possibly even a barcode scanner.

## Built With
Built with flutter and dart.
